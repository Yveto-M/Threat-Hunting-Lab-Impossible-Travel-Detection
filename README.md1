# Threat Hunting and Security Operations

## Threat Hunting Scenario: Impossible Travel Detection

### Overview

This lab simulates an "impossible travel" sign-in pattern, where a user appears to log in from geographically distant locations in an unfeasible time frameâ€”an indicator of potential credential compromise. The goal was to detect anomalous logins, investigate post-compromise activity, and perform full incident response in Microsoft Sentinel and Azure.

### Environment

- Microsoft Sentinel
- Microsoft Defender for Cloud
- Azure AD
- Windows 10 VM
- Kusto Query Language (KQL)

### Simulated Activity

- User account logged in from two geographically distant IP addresses within a short timeframe, simulating an "impossible travel" anomaly.
- Post-compromise activity was initiated within Azure, including VM access attempts.

### Investigation Process

- **Data Source:** `SigninLogs`  
- **Detection Rule:** Created a scheduled query rule to detect sign-ins from two different countries within 30 minutes.
- **KQL Logic:**
  - Queried `SigninLogs` for unique IPs and country locations.
  - Detected impossible travel using time and location constraints.
  - Correlated user behavior across timelines to confirm compromise.

- **Post-Login Investigation:**
  - Queried `AzureActivity` logs to identify actions taken after the suspicious login.
  - Detected unusual administrative behavior indicative of lateral movement or recon.

### Incident Response Actions

- **NIST 800-61 Aligned Response:**
  - Isolated affected user account.
  - Escalated incident to management.
  - Implemented conditional access policies to restrict risky sign-ins.
  - Required password reset and MFA enforcement.

### Conclusion

This lab demonstrated how to proactively detect and respond to credential-based threats using Microsoft Sentinel. By correlating login locations and timeline data, we confirmed malicious activity and followed a structured response process. This scenario emphasizes the importance of monitoring identity-based attacks and enforcing conditional access policies in cloud environments.
